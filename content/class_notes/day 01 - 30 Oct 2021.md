How does code run

int a = 10, b = 7
int c = a + b
print c  // 17

RAM 

Processor

Databus 

ALU

Output Register
o/p register
 
Input Register
i/p register


![How internally c = a + b is calculated](/images/notes/notes-image-003.png)


-----------

Which machine will perform better

A
1GHz
10^9 cc / sec
10^9 operations / sec
10^9 instructions / sec

B
2GHz
10^9 cc / sec
10^9 operations / sec
2 * 10^9 instructions / sec


Only processor speed doesnot describe which will perform better

It also depends on 

H/W
- Ram - speed and size
- cache memory

Instructions / clock cycle - generally only one instruction can run per clock cycle

s/w
- code optimisations
- OS
- 32 bit vs 64 bit 
- Architecture

Secondary Memory - HDD
Primary Memory - RAM

Give tow systems with every part is same except ram which will perform better
A
4GB

B
8GB

for A

we can store 2^32 unique address

smallest fetchable size of RAM is byte
1 byte = 8 bits
1 KB = 1024 B = 2^10 B
1MB = = 2^20 B
1GB = = 2^30 B 
4GB = = 2^32 Byte


For B 8gb
we need 2^33 address

who generate address
operating system - memory management unit

who carriess address
addres bus === signal 1 | no signal 0

As os cannot generate the address or as address bus cannot carry the extra bit, extra bit will be dropped off

4GB 64 Bit
OS - 64BIT
HW - 64 BIT
2^64 adderss support


------------------

8 bit binary for 18

18 - 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0

-18 - 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 ❌

2's complement = 1's complement + 1

1's complement = flip 0 and 1

------------------
18 = 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0

1s comp = 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1

2s comp = 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0

= -128 + 64 + 32 + 0 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 0

= -18

------------------
98  = 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0

-98 1s = 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1

2s = 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0

------------------
47 = 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1

-47 1s = 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0

2s = 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1

------------------


### Sign Magnitude

0 - 0 0 0 0

0 - 1 0 0 0 

'0' is represented in two ways which is not correct

###  2's complement

0 - 0 0 0 0

-8 - 1 0 0 0 

Sign magnitude is wrong notation

2's complement is correct way to show negative number

## Data Types

- int - 4 B
- char - 1 B / 2 B Java
- float - 4 B
- double - 8 GB
- bool - 1 B
- short - 2 B
- long - 4 B in c/c++(based on os) / 8 B in java
- long long ( c/c++ ) / not present in java 

signed - msb is negative

unsigned - msb is positive

should avoid long in c++

4 bit signed
- range [-8, 7]

4 bit un signed
- range [0, 15]


bits | signed | unsigned
|--|--|--|
1|-1,0|0,1
2|-2,1|0,3
4|-8,7|0,15
8|-128,127|0,255
n|-(2^n-1),(2^n-1)-1|0,(2^n) - 1 

int 32 -> -2^31, 2^31 - 1

2^10 = 1024 = 10^3

2^30 = 10^9

int = -2*10^9, 2*10^9  | 0, 4*10^9 - 1
long = -2^63, 2^63-1 | 0 , 2^64 - 1

flot 
double 

double has higher precision than float

```java
int sum(int arr[], int n) {
    int ans = 0;
    for ( int i = 0 ; i < n ;i++) {
        ans = ans + arr[i];
    } 
}
```

### A Problem in general
- Problem Description
- Constraints
- I/P format
- O/P format
- Sample I/P
- Sample O/P
- Explanation

Constraints play a major role in solving problems

Chose data type based on range

Operators
1. Arithemtic + - * / %
2. Logical && || !
3. Relational Operators < > <= >= == !=
4. Bitwise & | ^ ` <<  >>
5. = ?: ++ == += 

Left shift
a << i = a * (2 ^ i)

Right shift
a >> i = a / (2 ^ i)
