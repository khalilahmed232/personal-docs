## Problem

Given a string find the length of largest possible palindrome

```
    i/p: xybcdcbztzbcddcbzpzb
    o/p: 5 
```

Approach

We can say that a string from i to j is palindrome when forward hash = backward hash 

```
    s1: bztzb
    s2: bztzb
    h1 = h2 ==> palindrome

    s1: bzp
    s2: pzb
    h1 != h2 ==> not palindrome
```

Store forward hash and backward hash

![Forward and backward hashing](/images/notes/notes-image-001.png)

```java
    boolean check(int i, int j) {
        fh = fh(j) - fh(i - 1 );
        bh = bh(i) - bh(j+1);
        // balance powers 
        return fh == bh;
     }
```
Note: handle modulo subtraction and i = 0 and j = n - 1 cases

check function takes - O(1)

To check the largest posible substring we have to run N^2 times which is not better than previous soluitons

We can use binary search to optimize further

let us say x denotes length expansion. if i is center the strings is S[i-x: i+x]
least possible value of x will be 0 ( single letter palindrome )

![possible length before and after index](/images/notes/notes-image-002.png)

max possible value of x will be minimum of ( i, n - i - 1);



Low | High | Mid | Check | Ans
| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: | --: |
0 | MIN(8, 11) | 4 | (4, 12)✔ | 9 ✔
5 | 8 | 6 | (2, 14)❌ | 9 ✔
5 | 5 | 5 | (3, 13)❌ | 9 ✔

in step 1 - we are trying to check if with length = 4 if palindrome is possible at i = 4 using check funntion O(1)


for all centres we need to find out max palindrome

and ans will be max of the abobe

for even x = c1, y = n - c2 -1

m [c1 -m , c2- m]


time N+N+ N log N * O(1) + ------ (same for even) 

Overall steps
1. calculate fh, bh
2. implement check fn
3. for each index
4. find max using binary search

Topics used in solving this problem
1. Binary search
2. Prefix sum
3. Pre computation
4. Rolling hash

Alternative optimized soultion in O(N)

```
    x = 0
    i = [0, n)
        c = i 
        j = [x + 1, min(i, n - i + 1)]
            if ( check ( c-j, c+j) == i ) 
                x = j
            else 
                break
```
similar code for even also

## Game Theory

General Constraints
* 2 player games
* Alternative turns
* Winning Conditions

Problem
There are N Coins, each player can pick 1, 2 or 3 coins at one time. 
Player who picks the last coin wins the game

eg
n -> 21 -> 18 -> 16 -> 15 -> 12 -> 10 -> 8 -> 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 0


for a value of N



W - there exists one move goes to L

L - for all moves wining to W

1. Optimal vs Optimal
    | N   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
    |-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
    | W/L | W | W | W | L | W | W | W | L | W |

    P1 will win when n%4 == 0
2. Greedy vs Greedy
    | N   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
    |-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
    | W/L | W | W | W | L | L | L | W | W | W |

    P1 will win when n%6 <= 1,2 or 3
3. Greedy vs Optimal
    | N      | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11  |
    |--------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|-----|
    | G – P1 | W | W | W | L | L | L | W | L | L | L  | L   |
    | O – P1 | W | W | W | L | W | W | W | W | W | W  | W   |

    Greedy Win
    G starts and N = 1, 2, 3 or 7 

    O strats and N = 4


    else in all other cases 

    Optimal wins


3 problems
1. moves = 1, 2, 3
2. moves = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, ..
3. moves = 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, .. 

Pre compute the point table and use for all queries so that time complexity is T + N instead of T * N

## Problem N Piles

There are n piles of coins. In any turn, any player can pick any numebr of coins in a single pile, not for different piles. Player picking the last coin will win 

| p1 | 9 | 5 | 12 | 3 |
|----|---|---|----|---|
| p2 | 9 | 5 | 0  | 3 |
| p1 | 6 | 1 | 0  | 3 |
| p2 | 2 | 1 | 0  | 3 |
| p1 | 2 | 1 | 0  | 1 |
| p2 | 0 | 1 | 0  | 1 |
| p1 | 0 | 0 | 0  | 1 |
| p2 | 0 | 0 | 0  | 0 |


1. if XOR == 0 for all moves XOR != 0
2. if XOR != 0 if there exists XOR == 0

1 0 1 1 0 - ( 22 )
1 1 1 1 0 - ( 30 )
0 0 1 0 1 - ( 5 )
0 1 0 0 1 - ( 9 )
0 1 1 0 0 - ( 12 )

0 1 0 0 0 - ( 8 ) <- XOR of above 5


This problem is called nims game

answer can be found by xor all ( no of possibilities ) 
1. if xor all = 0 then lose
2. if xor all != 0 then win

3 problems before were Grundy Number

## Problem - Subset with sum 'k'

k = 19 

 0 1  2  3 4  5

10 3 -6 15 8 -7
